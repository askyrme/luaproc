*** CHANGELOG ***

[v1.0-4]

* Changed luaproc.newproc to be able to receive a Lua function as an argument.
Suggested by Mason Bogue.

* Fixed luaproc.newproc to handle binary strings properly. Calling
luaproc.newproc(string.dump(f)) now works fine. Bug reported by Mason Bogue.

* Minor Makefile improvements.

* Documentation (README) format improvements.

* Created an ISSUES file to describe known issues.

* Fixed standard library load in Lua processes in Lua 5.3 to include the UTF8
library.

* Fixed luaproc library load function (luaopen_luaproc) to prevent problems when
require'ing luaproc from within a Lua process. Although it is not necessary to
require luaproc from within Lua processes, doing so would cause a deadlock.

[v1.0-3]

* Fixed standard library load in new Lua processes. In Lua 5.2 the bit32
standard library must also be loaded. In Lua 5.2 and 5.3 the coroutine
standard library must also be loaded.

[v1.0-2]

* Added macros for compatibility with Lua 5.2 and 5.3.

* Removed global name registration in parent when loading luaproc.

[v1.0-1]

* Major code revision by Pablo Musa:
  - Internal data structures are now stored in Lua tables, removing the need
    for memory management in C;
  - Messages can contain strings, numbers, booleans and nil;
  - Improved error handling in Lua processes;
  - Functions luaproc.createworker and luaproc.destroyworker replaced by 
    function luaproc.setnumworkers;
  - Added function luaproc.getnumworkers;
  - Code clean-up.

* Added support to send and receive messages to/from main Lua script, which
  also resulted in a unified API for both the main (parent) Lua script and the
  child Lua processes (created with luaproc.newproc).

* Removed function luaproc.exit.

* Added function luaproc.wait, which waits until all Lua processes have
  finished executing and can be used for synchronization. Unlike luaproc.exit,
  which had to be the last function to be called, luaproc.wait can be called at
  any point in a script. It is always implicitly called when the main Lua
  script finishes executing.

* Fixed a race condition that was trigged by the main Lua script exiting while
  luaproc workers were active. When Lua unloads dynamic libraries with 
  dlclose() while it is exiting, pthreads is unloaded while workers are still 
  active, causing a segmentation fault. Workers (pthreads) are now joined, via
  a finalizer, when luaproc is unloaded.

* Fixed a race condition when creating new Lua processes with recycling.

* Fixed include guard conflict in sched.h (now lpsched.h).

* Included release in LuaRocks.

[v1.0b1]

* First public beta release.
